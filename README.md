# Smart-Irrigation-Mobile-App

The project described above is a smart irrigation mobile app I developed using Android Studio for a client. This app enables remote watering and provides real-time data on plant moisture, humidity, and temperature. Additionally, it features a built-in weather display showing current conditions and a 7-day forecast. The app is integrated with custom microcontroller sensors I designed for the client, and it securely stores and retrieves relevant data from a Firebase database.

To fetch weather data, the app utilizes APIs.

Upcoming features, outlined in the README, include:

Custom push notifications to alert users about moisture and humidity levels.
Vibration feedback for specific button interactions.
Saving and tracking irrigation history in the database.
Allowing users to make watering decisions based on weather forecasts.
Enabling users to easily adjust watering schedules and more.
The next commit/updated is expected before November 2023.
