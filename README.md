# Smart-Irrigation-Mobile-App

The project described above is a smart irrigation mobile app I developed using Android Studio for a client. This app enables remote watering and provides real-time data on plant moisture, humidity, and temperature. Additionally, it features a built-in weather display showing current conditions and a 7-day forecast. The app is integrated with custom microcontroller sensors I designed for the client, and it securely stores and retrieves relevant data from a Firebase database.

To fetch weather data, the app utilizes APIs.

Upcoming features, outlined in the README, include:

*Custom push notifications to alert users about moisture and humidity levels.
*Vibration feedback for specific button interactions.
*Saving and tracking irrigation history in the database.
*Allowing users to make watering decisions based on weather forecasts.
*Enabling users to easily adjust watering schedules and more.
*The next commit/updated is expected before November 2023.

Below are some pictures of the App.
**Ps I still need to add more content to the weather Activity:
